This project delves into the application of evolutionary algorithms as a gradient-free approach to refine the design of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, moving away from the conventional reliance on gradient-based optimization techniques that often encounter difficulties in exploring intricate architecture landscapes and adjusting hyperparameters. Our focus is on tailoring CNNs for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset, leveraging a hybrid selection strategy that integrates tournament and lexicase methods to enhance accuracy, streamline computational demands, and improve adaptability in resource-limited settings. The project stands out due to its pursuit of automated solutions for evolving neural network structures, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and optimizing weights through genetic processes. These approaches skillfully navigate the expansive array of possible neural configurations and parameter settings, uncovering superior designs that elevate classification performance, broaden generalization capabilities, and optimize resource usage.
